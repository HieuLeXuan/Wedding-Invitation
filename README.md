## 📦 Documentation

* Run the command `npm install`, then `npm run dev`, and open `http://localhost:8080`.  
* Edit the content of `index.html` as you wish.  
* If you don’t want to use the **comment feature**, remove the `data-url` and `data-key` attributes in the `<body>` element of index.html.  
* Adjust the `data-url` in the `<body>` of both index and dashboard according to your backend URL (if you host it yourself).  
* Also adjust the `data-key` in index with the access key that you can obtain from the dashboard.  
* If you want to use GIFs, get a Tenor API key from [developers.google.com/tenor](https://developers.google.com/tenor/guides/quickstart).  
* For deployment, run `npm run build:public`. The **public** folder is the one you will upload.  
* For backend self-hosting, see the explanation below, or use the **free trial API**.

> This invitation only uses regular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
> NPM is used so that JavaScript files can be executed directly (not module type).

> If you still want to use it without NPM, change  
> `src="./dist/guest.js"`  
> to  
> `src="./js/guest.js" type="module"`  
> in the `<head>` tag of index and dashboard.html, with the risk of a theme glitch at initial loading.

> If you have any questions, please use the `discussions` feature so others can also read them.

> [!WARNING]  
> Use version **3.14.0**, since version 4 is still under development and may contain bugs 🐛
